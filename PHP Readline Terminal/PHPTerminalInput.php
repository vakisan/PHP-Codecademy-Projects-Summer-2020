<!-- Your program should handle three situations:

If the userâ€™s name is greater than 8 characters, you should print "Hi, [THEIR NAME]. That's a long name."
If their name is between 4 and 8 characters (inclusive), you should print "Hi, [THEIR NAME].".
And if their name is 3 characters or fewer, you should print "Hi, [THEIR NAME]. That's a short name.".
